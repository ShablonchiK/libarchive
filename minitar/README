"minitar" is a minimal example of a program that uses
libarchive to read/write various archive formats.

By tinkering with the compile-time definitions, you
can create a statically-linked program on FreeBSD
that dearchives most common tar formats and is
only about 64k in size.  There are options to
enable non-tar formats, archive creation, and
automatic decompression support.

I use this as a test bed to check for "link pollution,"
ensuring that a program using libarchive does not
pull in unnecessary code.

The "minitar" program is also a good starting point
for anyone who wants to use libarchive for their
own purposes, as it demonstrates basic usage of
the library.
